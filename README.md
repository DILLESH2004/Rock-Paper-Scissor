Rock-Paper_Scissors:
Rock paper scissors is a simple hand game played between two people. Each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with an outstretched hand: "rock" (a closed fist), "paper" (a flat hand), or "scissors" (a fist with the index finger and middle finger extended, forming a V). The game has three possible outcomes: a draw, a win, or a loss.
